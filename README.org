#+TITLE: Android Lisp Games Kit (ALGK)

* Description
  Android Lisp Games Kit helps write android games using Common Lisp
  (ECL), OpenGL and SDL2.  It consists of an android application,
  SDL2, ECL, Swank, Lisp libraries and scripts.

* Current issues
  - Can't make the android dynamic loader to load fasls
    from any other directory than ~/data/app/org.algk-1/lib/arm64/~.  If
    you experienced the same issue, you need root access on your
    device to copy fasls to this directory.
  - Fasls are not bundled with the ALGK apk, so you have to copy them
    on your device after installing the apk.  Due to the above
    mentioned issue you have to copy them each time you reinstall
    ALGK.  Also you should copy the init script to a directory
    accessible for the ALGK process.
  - ALGK is tested for Arm64 architecture only.
  - Correct handling of OnPause/OnResume/OnStop/OnRestart events is
    not implemented.
  - ~sdl2.fasb~ is loaded with the following error: In method
    definition for PRINT-OBJECT, found an invalid specializer
    (SDL-POINT T).
* Dependencies
  Specified versions are versions for which I tested ALGK.
  - Android SDK API 23 (Android 6.0 Marshmallow)
  - Android NDK 14.0
  - ECL 16.1.3
  - Slime 2.19
  - SDL2 2.0.5
* Build
  You need a Unix environment.  In particular, you need the following
  packages: ~make~, ~bash~, ~findutils~, ~coreutils~.

  Create a file ~config.mk~ in ALGK directory and define the following
  variables:

  #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
    ANDROID_SDK_PATH ?= /path/to/android-sdk
    ANDROID_NDK_PATH ?= /path/to/android-ndk
    ECL_SRC_PATH     ?= /path/to/ecl-sources
    SLIME_PATH       ?= /path/to/slime
    SDL2_SRC_PATH    ?= /path/to/SDL2-sources
  #+END_SRC

  Then type ~make~.  Alternatively, you can specify the variables in
  the environment.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    export ANDROID_SDK_PATH=/path/to/android-sdk
    export ANDROID_NDK_PATH=/path/to/android-ndk
    export ECL_SRC_PATH=/path/to/ecl-sources
    export SLIME_PATH=/path/to/slime
    export SDL2_SRC_PATH=/path/to/SDL2-sources
    make
  #+END_SRC
* Install
  Install ~bin/algk-debug.apk~ on your device.  Copy all fasls from
  ~fasls~ to the ALGK lib directory on your device
  ~/data/app/org.algk-1/lib/arm64/~ (See the first issue).  Copy
  ~init.lisp~ and ~algk.lisp~ scripts to
  ~<your-primary-storage>/Android/data/org.algk/files/etc/~.
* Running
  Ensure that your device is connected to your LAN.  Start ALGK
  application on your device.  Run the following command in Emacs:
  ~M-x slime-connect~ and specify the device IP.
* Thanks
  I want to thank ECL developers and especially Daniel Kochma≈Ñski for
  his [[https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/ecl/ecl-android/][ecl-android project]] with Swank support.  Also, [[https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/index.html#orgheadline18][ECL blog post]] by
  David O'Toole was very helpful and inspiring.
